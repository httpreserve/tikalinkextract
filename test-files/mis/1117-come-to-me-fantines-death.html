 The Original Broadway Production,   Les Miserables the Musical - Come to Me (Fantine's Death) Lyrics. , FANTINE, Cosette, it's turned so cold, Cosette, it's past your bedtime, You've played the day away, And soon it will be night., Come to me, Cosette, the light is fading, Don't you see the evening star appearing?, Come to me, and rest against my shoulder, How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder., Hurry near, another day is dying, Don't you hear, the winter wind is crying?, There's a darkness which comes without a warning, But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning., VALJEAN, Oh, Fantine, our time is running out, But Fantine, I swear this on my life, FANTINE, Look, M'sieur, where all the children play, VALJEAN, Be at peace, be at peace evermore., FANTINE, My Cosette..., VALJEAN, Shall live in my protection, FANTINE, Take her now, VALJEAN, Your child will want for nothing, FANTINE, Good M'sieur, you come from God in Heaven., VALJEAN, And none shall ever harm Cosette, As long as I am living., FANTINE, Take my hand. The night grows ever colder., VALJEAN, Then I will keep you warm., FANTINE, Take my child. I give her to your keeping., VALJEAN, Take shelter from the storm, FANTINE, For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping, And tell Cosette I love her, And I'll see her when I wake..., [She dies with a smile. Javert arrives], BAMATABOIS, Here's something new. I think I'll give it a try., Come closer you! I like to see what I buy..., The usual price, for just a slice of your pie, FANTINE, I don't want you. No, no, m'sieur, let me go., BAMATABOIS, Is this a trick? I won't pay more!, FANTINE, No, not at all., BAMATABOIS, You've got some nerve, you little whore, You've got some gall., It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer, The customer sees what he gets in advance, It's not for the whore to say `yes sir' or `no sir', It's not for the harlot to pick and to choose, Or lead me to a dance!, [He hits her with his stick, she claws at his face, drawing blood], FANTINE, I'll kill you, you bastard,, try any of that!, Even a whore who has gone to the bad, Won't be had by a rat!, BAMATABOIS, By Christ you'll pay for what you've done, This rat will make you bleed, you'll see!, I guarantee, I'll make you suffer, For this disturbance of the peace, For this insult to life and property!, FANTINE, I beg you, don't report me sir, I'll do whatever you may want, BAMATABOIS, Make your excuse to the police!, [Javert enters, accompanied by constables], JAVERT, Tell me quickly what's the story, Who saw what and why and where, Let him give a full description, Let him answer to Javert!, In this nest of whores and vipers, Let one speak who saw it all, Who laid hands on this good man here?, What's the substance of this brawl?, BAMATABOIS, Javert, would you believe it, I was crossing from the park, When this prostitute attacked me, You can see she left her mark, JAVERT, She will answer for her actions, When you make a full report, You may rest assured, M'sieur,, That she will answer to the court., FANTINE, There's a child who sorely needs me, Please M'sieur, she's but that high, Holy God, is there no mercy?, If I go to jail she'll die!, JAVERT, I have heard such protestations, Every day for twenty years, Let's have no more explanations, Save your breath and save your tears, `Honest work, just reward,, That's the way to please the Lord.', [Fantine gives a last despairing cry as she is arrested by the constables..  Valjean emerges from the crowd], VALJEAN, A moment of your time, Javert, I do believe this woman's tale, VALJEAN, You've done your duty, let her be, She needs a doctor, not a jail., JAVERT, But M'sieur Mayor!, FANTINE, Can this be?, VALJEAN, Where will she end -, This child without a friend?, I've seen your face before, Show me some way to help you, How have you come to grief, In a place such as this?, FANTINE, M'sieur, don't mock me now, I pray, It's hard enough I've lost my pride, You let your foreman send me away, Yes, you were there, and turned aside, I never did no wrong, VALJEAN, Is it true, what I have done?, FANTINE, My daughter's close to dying..., VALJEAN, To an innocent soul?, FANTINE, If there's a God above, VALJEAN, Had I only known then..., FANTINE, He'd let me die instead, VALJEAN, In His name my task has just begun, I will see it done!, JAVERT, But M'sieur Mayor!, VALJEAN, I will see it done!, JAVERT, But M'sieur Mayor!, VALJEAN, I will see it done!, VOICES, Look out! It's a runaway cart! Les Miserables Lyrics
