 The Original Broadway Production,  Les Miserables the Musical - Work Song Lyrics.  PRISONERS, Look down, look down, Don't look 'em in the eye, Look down, look down,, You're here until you die, CONVICT ONE, The sun is strong, It's hot as hell below, PRISONER, Look down, look down,, There's twenty years to go, CONVICT TWO, I've done no wrong!, Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!, PRISONERS, Look down look down.  Sweet Jesus doesn't care, CONVICT THREE, I know she'll wait,, I know that she'll be true!, PRISONERS, Look down, look down,, They've all forgotten you, CONVICT FOUR, When I get free ya won't see me, Here for dust!, PRISONERS, Look down, look down, Don't look 'em in the eye, CONVICT FIVE, How long, oh Lord, Before you let me die?, PRISONERS, Look down, look down,, You'll always be a slave, Look down, look down,, You're standing in your grave, JAVERT, Now bring me prisoner 24601, Your time is up, And your parole's begun, You know what that means., VALJEAN, Yes, it means I'm free., JAVERT, No!, It means you get, Your yellow ticket-of-leave, You are a thief, VALJEAN, I stole a loaf of bread., JAVERT, You robbed a house., .  VALJEAN, I broke a window pane., My sister's child was close to death, And we were starving., JAVERT, You will starve again, Unless you learn the meaning of the law., VALJEAN, I know the meaning of those 19 years, A slave of the law, JAVERT, Five years for what you did, The rest because you tried to run, Yes, 24601., VALJEAN, My name is Jean Valjean, JAVERT, And I am Javert, Do not forget my name!, Do not forget me,, 24601., PRISONERS, Look down, look down, You'll always be a slave, Look down, look down, You're standing in your grave..  VALJEAN, Freedom is mine. The earth is still., I feel the wind. I breathe again., And the sky clears, The world is waking., Drink from the pool. How clean the taste., Never forget the years, the waste., Nor forgive them, For what they've done., They are the guilty - everyone., The day begins..., And now lets see, What this new world, Will do for me!, [He finds work on a farm], FARMER, You'll have to go, I'll pay you off for the day, Collect your bits and pieces there, And be on your way., VALJEAN, You have given me half, What the other men get!, This handful of tin, Wouldn't buy my sweat!, LABORER, You broke the law, It's there for people to see, Why should you get the same, As honest men like me?, VALJEAN, Now every door is closed to me, Another jail. Another key. Another chain, For when I come to any town, They check my papers, And they find the mark of Cain, In their eyes I see their fear, `We do not want you here.', [He comes to an inn], INKEEPER'S WIFE, My rooms are full, And I've no supper to spare, I'd like to help a stranger, All we want is to be fair, VALJEAN, I will pay in advance, I can sleep in a barn, You see how dark it is, I'm not some kind of dog!, INNKEEPER, You leave my house, Or feel the weight of my rod, We're law-abiding people here, Thanks be to God., [They throw him out of the inn], VALJEAN, And now I know how freedom feels, The jailer always at your heels, It is the law!, This piece of paper in my hand, That makes me cursed throughout the land, It is the law!, Like a cur, I walk the street,, The dirt beneath their feet., [He sits down despairingly outside a house from which emerges the Bishop of Digne.], BISHOP, Come in, Sir, for you are weary,, And the night is cold out there., Though our lives are very humble, What we have, we have to share., There is wine here to revive you., There is bread to make you strong,, There's a bed to rest till morning,, Rest from pain, and rest from wrong., VALJEAN, He let me eat my fill, I had the lion's share, The silver in my hand, Cost twice what I had earned, In all those nineteen years -, That lifetime of despair, And yet he trusted me., The old fool trusted me -, He'd done his bit of good, I played the grateful serf, And thanked him like I should, But when the house was still,, I got up in the night., Took the silver, Took my flight! Les Miserables Lyrics.
