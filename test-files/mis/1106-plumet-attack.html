 The Original Broadway Production,  Les Miserables the Musical - Plumet Attack . .  .  Lyrics. . . , EPONINE, 'Parnasse, what are you doing, So far out of our patch?, MONTPARNASSE, This house, we're going to do it, Rich man, plenty of scratch, You remember he's the one, Who got away the other day, Got a number on his chest, Perhaps a fortune put away!, EPONINE, Oh Lord, somebody help me!, Dear God, what'll I do?, He'll think this is an ambush, He'll think I'm in it too!, What'll I do, what'll I say?, I've got to warn them here, I've got to find a way., (Thenardier arrives with the rest of his gang), THENARDIER, This is his lair, I've seen the old fox around, He keeps himself to himself, He's staying close to the ground, I smell profit here!, Ten years ago.  He came and paid for Cosette, I let her go for a song, It's time we settled the debt, This'll cost him dear, BRUJON, What do I care, Who you should rob?, Gimme me my share, Finish the job!, THENARDIER, You shut your mouth, Give me your hand, BRUJON, (catching sight of Eponine), What have we here?, THENARDIER, (not recognizing her), Who is this hussy?, BABET, It's your brat Eponine, Don't you know your own kid, Why's she hanging about you?, THENARDIER, Eponine, get on home, You're not needed in this, We're enough here without you, EPONINE, I know this house, I tell you there's nothing here for you, Just the old man and the girl, They live ordinary lives, THENARDIER, Don't interfere, You've got some gall, Take care, young miss,, You've got a lot to say!, BRUJON, She's going soft, CLAQUESOUS, Happens to all, MONTPARNASSE, Go home, 'Ponine,, Go home, you're in the way, EPONINE, I'm gonna scream, I'm gonna warn them here., THENARDIER, One little scream and you'll regret it for a year., CLAQUESOUS, What a palaver, What an absolute treat, To watch a cat and its father, Pick a bone in the street, BRUJON, Not a sound out of you!, EPONINE, Well I told you I'd do it, told you I'd do it..., (She screams), THENARDIER, You wait my girl, you'll rue this night, I'll make you scream, you'll scream all right, Leave her to me, don't wait around, Make for the sewers, go underground!, (The gang scatters. Marius and Cosette run back into the garden.  and he hurriedly introduces Eponine before she takes off), MARIUS, It was your cry sent them away, Once more 'Ponine saving the day, Dearest Cosette - my friend 'Ponine, Brought me to you, showed me the way!, Someone is near, Let's not be seen, Somebody's here!, (Marius leaves quickly as Valjean enters), VALJEAN, My God, Cosette!, I heard a cry in the dark, I heard the shout of angry voices in the street., COSETTE, That was my cry you heard, Papa,, I was afraid of what they'd do., They ran away when they heard my cry., VALJEAN, Cosette, my child, what will become of you?, COSETTE, Three men I saw beyond the wall, Three men in shadow moving fast, JAVERT, This is a warning to us all, These are the shadows of the past, Must be Javert!, He's found my cover at last!, I've got to get Cosette away, Before they return!, We must get away from shadows, They will never let us be, Tomorrow to Calais..., And then a ship across the sea!, Hurry, Cosette, prepare to leave and say no more,, Tomorrow we'll away!, Hurry, Cosette, it's time to close another door, And live another day!
