THENARDIER, But we're the ones who take it, We're the ones who make it in the end!, Watch the buggers dance, Watch 'em till they drop, Keep your wits about you, And you stand on top!, Masters of the land, Always get our share, Clear away the barricades, And we're still there!, We know where the wind is blowing, Money is the stuff we smell., And when we're rich as Croesus, Jesus! Won't we see you all in hell!,.  (Valjean is alone in the shadows, with a bare wooden cross for company), VALJEAN, Alone I wait in the shadows, I count the hours till I can sleep, I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by, It made her weep to know I die., Alone at the end of the day, Upon this wedding night I pray, Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace, And show them grace., God on high, Hear my prayer, Take me now, To thy care, Where You are, Let me be, Take me now, Take me there, Bring me home, Bring me home., (Fantine's spirit appears to Valjean), FANTINE, M'sieur, I bless your name, M'sieur, lay down your burden, You raised my child in love, And you will be with god., .

They said you'd gone away., VALJEAN, Cosette, my child, am I forgiven now?, Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day., MARIUS, It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool, It's you who must forgive a thankless man, It's thanks to you that I am living, And again I lay down my life at your feet., Cosette, your father is a saint., When they wounded me, He took me from the barricade, Carried like a babe, And brought me home to you!, VALJEAN(to Cosette), Now you are here, Again beside me, Now I can die in peace, For now my life is blessed..., COSETTE, You will live, Papa, you're going to live, It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!, VALJEAN, Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die, I'll obey,, I will try., On this page, I write my last confession., Read it well, When I at last am sleeping., It's the story, Of those who always loved you., Your mother gave her life for you, Then gave you to my keeping., (The other spirits, including Eponine appear), FANTINE, Come with me, Where chains will never bind you, All your grief, At last, at last behind you., Lord in Heaven,, Look down on him in mercy., VALJEAN, Forgive me all my trespasses, And take me to your glory., FANTINE &amp; EPONINE, Take my hand, And lead me to salvation., Take my love,, For love is everlasting., VALJEAN, FANTINE &amp; EPONINE, And remember, The truth that once was spoken, To love another person, Is to see the face of God!
