 The Original Broadway Production,  Les Miserables the Musical - The First Attack Lyrics.  ENJOLRAS, Take this and use it well!, But if you shoot us in the back,, You'll never live to tell..  .  STUDENT ONE.  Platoon of sappers advancing toward the barricade!, STUDENT TWO.  Troops behind them, fifty men or more!, ENJOLRAS.  Fire!, (Gunfire is heard), FEUILLY, Sniper!, (Valjean shoots a sniper who is aiming at Enjolras), .  LESGLES, See how they run away!, GRANTAIRE.  By God we've won the day!, ENJOLRAS, They will be back again,, Make an attack again., (To Valjean.), For your presence of mind, For the deed you have done, I will thank you M'sieur, When our battle is won..  .  VALJEAN, Give me no thanks M'sieur, There is something you can do., ENJOLRAS, If it is in my power., VALJEAN, Give me the spy Javert, Let me take care of him!, JAVERT, The law is inside out, The world is upside down, ENJOLRAS, Do what you have to do,, The man belongs to you., The enemy may be regrouping. Hold yourself in readiness., Come my friends, back to your positions., The night is falling fast..  VALJEAN, We meet again., JAVERT, You've hungered for this all your life;, Take your revenge!, How right you should kill with a knife!, (Valjean cuts the ropes which bind Javert.), VALJEAN, You talk too much,, Your life is safe in my hands., JAVERT,  Don't understand, VALJEAN, Get out of here., JAVERT.  Valjean, take care!, I'm warning you..., VALJEAN.  Clear out of here., JAVERT, Once a thief, forever a thief, What you want you always steal!, You would trade your life for mine., Yes, Valjean, you want a deal!, Shoot me now for all I care!, If you let me go, beware,, You'll still answer to Javert!.  .  VALJEAN, You are wrong, and always have been wrong., I'm a man, no worse than any man., You are free, and there are no conditions,, No bargains or petitions., There's nothing that I blame you for. . . . . .  . , You've done your duty, nothing more., If I come out of this alive, you'll find me.  At number fifty-five Rue Plumet, No doubt our paths will cross again..  (Valjean fires his gun into the air, Javert leaves quickly..  Muted applause from the students who think Javert has been shot), ENJOLRAS, Courfeyrac, you take the watch, They won't attack until it's light, Everybody stay awake, We must be ready for the fight, For the final fight, Let no one sleep tonight! Les Miserables Lyrics
