 The Original Broadway Production,   Les Miserables the Musical - Who Am I? Lyrics.  , . , VALJEAN, He thinks that man is me, He knew him at a glance!, That stranger he has found, This man could be my chance!, Why should I save his hide?, Why should I right this wrong, When I have come so far, And struggled for so long?, If I speak, I am condemned., If I stay silent, I am damned!, I am the master of hundreds of workers., They all look to me., How can I abandon them?, How would they live, If I am not free?, If I speak, I am condemned., If I stay silent, I am damned!, Who am I?, Can I condemn this man to slavery, Pretend I do not feel his agony, This innocent who bears my face, Who goes to judgement in my place, Who am I?, Can I conceal myself for evermore?, Pretend I'm not the man I was before?, And must my name until I die, Be no more than an alibi?, Must I lie?, How can I ever face my fellow men?, How can I ever face myself again?, My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago, He gave me hope when hope was gone, He gave me strength to journey on, Who am I? Who am I?, I am Jean Valjean!, And so Javert, you see it's true, That man bears no more guilt than you!, Who am I?, 24601! Les Miserables Lyrics
