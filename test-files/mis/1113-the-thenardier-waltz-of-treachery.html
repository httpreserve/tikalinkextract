 The Original Broadway Production,  Les Miserables the Musical - The Thenardier Waltz of Treachery Lyrics. , THENARDIER, What to do? What to say?, Shall you carry our treasure away?, What a gem! What a pearl!, Beyond rubies is our little girl!, How can we speak of debt?, Let's not haggle for darling Cosette!, Dear Fantine, gone to rest..., Have we done for her child what is best?, Shared our bread. Shared each bone., Treated her like she's one of our own!, Like our own, Monsieur!, VALJEAN, Your feelings do you credit, sir, And I will ease the parting blow, He pays them., Let us not talk of bargains or bones or greed, Now, may I say, we are agreed?, MME. THENARDIER, That would quite fit the bill, If she hadn't so often been ill, Little dear, cost us dear, Medicines are expensive, M'sieur, Not that we begrudged a sou, It's no more than we Christians must do!, M. &amp; MME. THENARDIER, One thing more, one small doubt, There are treacherous people about, No offense. Please reflect., Your intentions may not be correct?, VALJEAN, No more words. Here's your price., Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice., Come, Cosette, say goodbye, Let us seek out some friendlier sky., Thank you both for Cosette, It won't take you too long to forget., (Valjean and Cosette leave the inn), Come, Cosette, come, my dear, From now on I will always be here, Where I go, you will be., YOUNG COSETTE, Will there be children and castles to see?, VALJEAN, Yes, Cosette, yes, it's true., There's a castle just waiting for you., VALJEAN &amp; YOUNG COSETTE, La la la la la...
