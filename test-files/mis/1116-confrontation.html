 The Original Broadway Production,   Les Miserables the Musical - Confrontation Lyrics. , JAVERT, Valjean, at last,, We see each other plain, `M'sieur le Mayor,', You'll wear a different chain!, VALJEAN, Before you say another word, Javert, Before you chain me up like a slave again, Listen to me! There is something I must do., This woman leaves behind a suffering child., There is none but me who can intercede,, In Mercy's name, three days are all I need., Then I'll return, I pledge my word., Then I'll return..., JAVERT, You must think me mad!, I've hunted you across the years, A man like you can never change, A man such as you., VALJEAN (in counterpoint), Believe of me what you will, There is a duty that I'm sworn to do, You know nothing of my life, All I did was steal some bread, You know nothing of the world, You would sooner see me dead, But not before I see this justice done, I am warning you Javert, I'm a stronger man by far, There is power in me yet, My race is not yet run, I am warning you Javert, There is nothing I won't dare, If I have to kill you here, I'll do what must be done!.  .  JAVERT (in counterpoint), Men like me can never change, Men like you can never change, No,, 24601, My duty's to the law - you have no, Rights, Come with me 24601, Now the wheel has turned around, Jean Valjean is nothing now, Dare you talk to me of crime, And the price you had to pay, Every man is born in sin, Every man must choose his way, You know nothing of Javert, I was born inside a jail, I was born with scum like you, I am from the gutter too!, VALJEAN, [to Fantine] And this I swear to you tonight, JAVERT, [to Valjean] There is no place for you to hide, VALJEAN, Your child will live within my care, JAVERT, Wherever you may hide away, VALJEAN, And I will raise her to the light., VALJEAN AND JAVERT, I swear to you, I will be there!
