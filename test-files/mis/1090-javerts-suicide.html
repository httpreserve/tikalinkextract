 The Original Broadway Production,  Les Miserables the Musical - Javert's Suicide Lyrics. , JAVERT, Who is this man?, What sort of devil is he?, To have me caught in a trap, And choose to let me go free?, It was his hour at last, To put a seal on my fate, Wipe out the past, And wash me clean off the slate!, All it would take, Was a flick of his knife, Vengeance was his, And he gave me back my life!, Damned if I'll live in the debt of a thief!, Damned if I'll yield at the end of the chase., I am the Law and the Law is not mocked, I'll spit his pity right back in his face, There is nothing on earth that we share, It is either Valjean or Javert!, How can I now allow this man, To hold dominion over me?, This desperate man whom I have hunted, He gave me my life, he gave me freedom., I should have perished by his hand!, It was his right..  It was my right to die as well, Instead I live, but live in hell!, And my thoughts fly apart, Can this man be believed?, Shall his sins be forgiven?, Shall his crimes be reprieved?, And must I now begin to doubt, Who never doubted all these years?, My heart is stone and still it trembles, The world I have known is lost in shadow., Is he from heaven or from hell?, And does he know, That granting me my life today, This man has killed me even so?, I am reaching, but I fall, And the stars are black and cold., As I stare into the void, Of a world that cannot hold, I'll escape now from the world, From the world of Jean Valjean, There is nowhere I can turn, There is no way to go on... Les Miserables Lyrics
