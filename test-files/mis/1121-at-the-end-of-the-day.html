 The Original Broadway Production,   Les Miserables the Musical - At the End of the Day Lyrics.  , . , THE POOR, At the end of the day you're another day older, And that's all you can say for the life of the poor, It's a struggle, it's a war, And there's nothing that anyone's giving, One more day standing about, what is it for?, One day less to be living., At the end of the day you're another day colder, And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill, And the righteous hurry past, They don't hear the little ones crying, And the winter is coming on fast, ready to kill, One day nearer to dying!, At the end of the day there's another day dawning, And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise, Like the waves crash on the sand, Like a storm that'll break any second, There's a hunger in the land, There's a reckoning still to be reckoned and, There's gonna be hell to pay, At the end of the day!, FOREMAN, At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing, Sitting flat on your butt doesn't buy any bread, WORKER ONE, There are children back at home, WORKERS ONE AND TWO, And the children have got to be fed, WORKER TWO, And you're lucky to be in a job, WOMAN, And in a bed!, WORKERS, And we're counting our blessings!, WOMAN TWO, Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today?, With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?, WOMAN THREE, It's because little Fantine won't give him his way, WOMAN ONE, Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands!, WOMAN FOUR, And the boss, he never knows, That the foreman is always in heat, WOMAN THREE, If Fantine doesn't look out, Watch how she goes, She'll be out on the street!.  WORKERS, At the end of the day it's another day over, With enough in your pocket to last for a week, Pay the landlord, pay the shop, Keep on grafting as long as you're able, Keep on grafting till you drop, Or it's back to the crumbs off the table, You've got to pay your way, At the end of the day!, GIRL (Grabbing a letter from Fantine), And what have we here, little innocent sister?, Come on Fantine, let's have all the news!, [Reading the letter], Ooh..."Dear Fantine you must send us more money..., Your child needs a doctor..., There's no time to lose...", FANTINE, Give that letter to me, It is none of your business, With a husband at home, And a bit on the side!, Is there anyone here, Who can swear before God, She has nothing to fear?, She has nothing to hide?, [They fight over the letter. Valjean (M. Madeleine) rushes on to break up the squabble.], VALJEAN, Will someone tear these two apart, What is this fighting all about?, This is a factory, not a circus!, Now, come on ladies, settle down, I run a business of repute, I am the Mayor of this town, [To the foreman], I look to you to sort this out, And be as patient as you can-, [He goes back into the factory], FOREMAN, Now someone say how this began!, GIRL, At the end of the day, She's the one who began it!, There's a kid that she's hiding, In some little town, There's a man she has to pay, You can guess how she picks up the extra, You can bet she's earning her keep, Sleeping around, And the boss wouldn't like it!, FANTINE, Yes it's true there's a child, And the child is my daughter, And her father abandoned us, Leaving us flat, Now she lives with an innkeeper man, And his wife, And I pay for the child, What's the matter with that?, WOMEN, At the end of the day, She'll be nothing but trouble, And there's trouble for all, When there's trouble for one!, While we're earning our daily bread, She's the one with her hands in the butter, You must send the slut away, Or we're all gonna end in the gutter, And it's us who'll have to pay, At the end of the day!, FOREMAN, I might have known the bitch could bite, I might have known the cat had claws, I might have guessed your little secret, Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine, Who keeps herself so pure and clean, You'd be the cause I had no doubt, Of any trouble hereabout, You play a virgin in the light, But need no urgin' in the night., GIRL, She's been laughing at you.  While she's having her men, WOMEN, She'll be nothing but trouble again and again, WOMAN, You must sack her today, WORKERS, Sack the girl today!, FOREMAN, Right my girl. On your way!
