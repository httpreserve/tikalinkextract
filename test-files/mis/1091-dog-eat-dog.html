 The Original Broadway Production,  Les Miserables the Musical - Dog Eat Dog Lyrics. , THENARDIER, Here's a hint of gold, Stuck into a tooth, Pardon me M'sieur, You won't be needing it no more., Shouldn't be too hard to sell., Add it to the pile, Add it to the stock, Here among the sewer rats, A breath away from Hell, You get accustomed to the smell., Well someone's got to clean 'em up, my friends, Bodies on the highway, Law and order upside down, Someone's got to collect their odds and ends, As a service to the town!, (Valjean arrives, carrying MARIUS..  VALJEAN collapses), (THENARDIER robs marius), Here's a tasty ring, Pretty little thing, Wouldn't want to waste it, That would really be a crime, Thank you sir, I'm in your debt, Here's another toy, Take it off the boy, His heart's no longer going, And he's lived his little time, But his watch is ticking yet!, Well, someone's got to clean them up, my friends, Before the little harvest, Disappears into the mud, Someone's got to collect their odds and ends, When the gutters run with blood., It's a world where the dog eats the dog, Where they kill for bones in the street, And God in His Heaven, He don't interfere, 'Cause he's dead as the stiffs at my feet, I raise my eyes to see the heavens, And only the moon looks down, The harvest moon shines down!, (He turns over Valjean's body, recognizes him, and leaves..  Eventually, Valjean picks up Marius again and walks, through the sewers. As they emerge, they meet Javert),.  VALJEAN, It's you, Javert!, I knew you wouldn't wait too long, The faithful servant at his post once more!, This man's done no wrong,, And he needs a doctor's care., JAVERT, I warned you I would not give in, I won't be swayed, VALJEAN, Another hour yet, And then I'm yours, And all our debts are paid., JAVERT, The man of mercy comes again, And talks of justice, JAVERT, Come, time is running short, Look down, Javert, He's standing in his grave, Give way, Javert, There is a life to save., JAVERT(overlapping), Take him Valjean,, Before I change my mind, I will be waiting, 24601.
